# Why?

Manually editing slides is annoying; especially if you're running an event/conference and want a feasible amount of control over which slides should be shown. We can't all use Keynote, or Powerpoint, or Google Slides / etc, either.

This software / app is an attempt to parameterize everything one might need as JSON data, which we can put as a serialized string in the browser's hash route.

Everything from colors, to sponsors, to speakers and times, and the hashtag or message, and the logo - are configurable through this object.

For example, serializing the following Object:

```js
{
    hashtag: "#spacecityjs",
    portrait: 0,
    showSponsors: 1,
    logo: { url: "http://www.spacecity.codes/images/logo-black.svg" },
    colors: {
        sponsors: "#38454d",
        background: "#1F2D4D",
        highlight: "#1F2D4D",
        toolbar: "#1F2D4D",
        main_font: "#fff",
        toolbar_font: "#ffda47"
    },

into a String and then injecting it into the hash with `window.location.hash = '#'+JSON.stringify(...)` will give the app the data it needs to render an entire, automated slide deck, complete with portrait and landscape modes, dynamic data, and the ability to control the current slide.

To see the above code as an example app, open https://matthiasak.github.io/conf-screen/, copy paste the above data, and paste it into the console, passing at as a parameter to `window.setData(...)`. This will automatically update the hash route and draw the data to the screen for you.
